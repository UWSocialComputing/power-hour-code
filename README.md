# Setup
Set up the `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend` folder.

Use two different terminals to navigate into `frontend` and `backend` respectively, first run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to spin up the server and run the app.

Use the url in the `frontend` terminal output to access the app interface.

Valid usernames include `test1` and `test3`.
