# Setup
Set up the `.env` files in both `frontend` and `backend` folder.

Use two different terminals to navigate into `frontend` and `backend` respectively.

In `frontend` folder, run `npm install` to install the packages, then run `npm run dev` to start the frontend application.

Use the url in the `frontend` terminal output to access the app interface.

In `backend` folder, first install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), then set up a virtual environment using
`conda env create -n power-hour python`, then `conda activate power-hour`, then `conda install pip`, and finally run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary packages.
Run `flask --app server run --debug` to start the backend server.
